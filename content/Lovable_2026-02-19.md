## Review Body

### The Promise: "Text to App" in Seconds
We've heard it before. "No-code is the future." But usually, that means drag-and-drop hell. **Lovable.dev** is different. It promises to let you describe an app in plain English, and it writes the React/Supabase code for you—instantly deployable.

### The Test: Building a CRM
I challenged Lovable to build a simple CRM for a real estate agency.
*   **Prompt:** "Build a dashboard with a list of properties, a map view, and a lead capture form."
*   **Result:** In ~45 seconds, I had a working Next.js app. The UI was clean (Tailwind), the database was connected (Supabase), and the auth worked.

### Lovable vs. Cursor
This is the big question.
*   **Cursor:** Is an IDE for *developers*. It helps you write code faster. You still need to know what a `useEffect` hook is.
*   **Lovable:** Is for *founders*. You don't need to know code. You just need to know what you want to build.

### Verdict
If you are a developer, stick with Cursor. It gives you control.
If you are a founder/entrepreneur who just wants the product *done*, **Lovable** is currently the best tool on the market. It feels like magic.

### Pricing
*   **Free:** Generous tier to test.
*   **Pro ($20/mo):** Deploy to custom domains and export code.

🚫 Stop hiring devs for MVP.
🤯 I just built a full CRM in 45 seconds using Lovable.dev.
It writes the React code, sets up the database, and deploys it.
This is the "Cursor for Founders."

**Is coding dead for founders?**

I tested **Lovable.dev** this weekend, and honestly, it's terrifyingly good.
I described a SaaS app in plain English, and it built the entire thing—frontend, backend, database—in under a minute.

If you're a non-technical founder, this is your new CTO.
