## Review Body

### The Problem: Calendar Tetris
If you're a Business Analyst or PM, your calendar is a warzone. You have 4 hours of meetings, 3 hours of "actual work," and zero contiguous blocks of time to do it. You spend half your day rescheduling things.

### The Solution: Reclaim.ai
**Reclaim.ai** isn't just a calendar; it's a bouncer for your time. You tell it what you need to do ("Review specs for 2 hours"), and it finds the time. If a meeting gets booked over it, Reclaim automatically moves your task to the next available slot. It defends your time so you don't have to.

### Key Features
*   **Habits:** Set recurring tasks like "Lunch" or "Code Review," and Reclaim ensures they happen, but moves them around conflicts.
*   **Smart 1:1s:** Automatically finds time for 1:1 meetings that works for both people.
*   **Buffer Time:** Automatically adds breaks between back-to-back Zoom calls.

### Reclaim vs. Motion
We reviewed **Motion** recently (see our review [here](/blog/top-productivity-ai-tools.html)). Here's the difference:
*   **Motion** is a project manager that schedules tasks. It's powerful but complex ($34/mo).
*   **Reclaim** is a calendar defender. It's simpler, integrates deeper with Google Calendar, and has a **generous free tier**.

### Verdict
If you live in Google Calendar, Reclaim is non-negotiable. It saves me about 3-4 hours of scheduling headaches every week. And the free plan is actually usable.

### Pricing
*   **Lite:** Free (forever!)
*   **Starter:** $8/month (Great for solo pros)
*   **Business:** $12/month

**Your calendar is managing you, not the other way around.**

I tested **Reclaim.ai**, and it's the first tool that actually "defends" my time.
Instead of manually blocking out "Focus Time" (which people ignore anyway), Reclaim dynamically schedules your tasks around your meetings.

If a meeting runs late? Reclaim moves your task.
Need a lunch break? Reclaim finds a slot.

It’s the best "set it and forget it" productivity tool I've used in 2026.
