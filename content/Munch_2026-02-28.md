## Review Body

### The Problem: Editing takes forever
If you have a podcast or a YouTube channel, you know the pain. You record for an hour, but turning that into 10 TikToks takes *another* 5 hours of editing, captioning, and cropping.

### The Solution: Munch AI
**Munch** (GetMunch) is an AI repurposing engine. You feed it a long video link (YouTube or upload), and it spits out 10-20 short, vertical clips that are ready to post.

But it's not just random cuts. Munch uses GPT-4 to analyze the content and pick the "most viral" moments based on trends.

### Key Features
*   **AI Curation:** It finds the hooks, the jokes, and the insights automatically.
*   **Auto-Captions:** The captions are 95% accurate and styled like popular creators (Alex Hormozi style).
*   **Virality Score:** It assigns a score to each clip predicting how well it will perform on TikTok/IG Reels.
*   **Platform Native:** Auto-crops to 9:16 and keeps the speaker centered.

### Verdict
For podcasters and agencies, Munch is an absolute no-brainer. It effectively automates your social media strategy. The time saved on editing clips is worth 10x the monthly cost.

### Pricing
*   **Pro:** ~$49/mo (worth it if you post daily)
*   **Elite:** For agencies managing multiple brands.
