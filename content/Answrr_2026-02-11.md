## Review Body

### What is Answrr?
Answrr is a cutting-edge AI receptionist developed by AIQ Labs Limited. Launched in early 2026, it's designed to replace traditional answering services for small businesses. Unlike basic IVR systems, Answrr uses advanced NLP to understand caller intent, answer FAQs, and even book appointments directly into your calendar.

### Key Features
- **24/7 Availability:** Never miss a lead, even at 3 AM.
- **Natural Conversations:** It doesn't sound like a robot; it pauses, listens, and responds contextually.
- **Appointment Booking:** Integrates with Calendly and Google Calendar.
- **CRM Sync:** Pushes call transcripts and lead data to HubSpot/Salesforce.

### Pricing
Answrr offers a tiered model starting at $49/mo for solopreneurs, scaling up for agencies.

### The Affiliate Angle (Why we're talking about it)
They just launched a massive partner program offering **30% Lifetime Recurring Commissions**. For a $100/mo client, that's $30/mo passive income for as long as they stay subscribed.

### Verdict
If you serve local businesses (dentists, real estate, law firms), Answrr is an easy sell. The tech is solid, and the affiliate terms are aggressive.
